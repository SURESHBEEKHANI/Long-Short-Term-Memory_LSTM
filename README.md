# Long-Short-Term-Memory_LSTM
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) designed to address the limitations of traditional RNNs, particularly in handling long-term dependencies. They are well-suited for tasks involving sequential data, such as time series forecasting, natural language processing, and speech recognition
