# Long-Short-Term-Memory_LSTM
Text Generation with LSTM Networks
Overview
This project demonstrates how to build and train a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network using TensorFlow and Keras for generating text. The LSTM model is designed to predict the next word in a sequence based on a given input text, making it suitable for various natural language processing tasks such as text completion and generation.
