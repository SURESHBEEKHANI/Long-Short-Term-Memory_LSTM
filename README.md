# Long-Short-Term-Memory_LSTM
Text Generation with LSTM Networks
Overview
This project demonstrates how to build and train a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network using TensorFlow and Keras for generating text. The LSTM model is designed to predict the next word in a sequence based on a given input text, making it suitable for various natural language processing tasks such as text completion and generation.

Components
Data Loading and Preprocessing
Data Loading: Data is loaded from a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.
Data Conversion: The DataFrame is converted into a list of lists and flattened into a single list of sentences.
Tokenization: Text data is tokenized using TensorFlow's Tokenizer to convert words into integer sequences.
Padding: Sequences are padded to ensure uniform length for model training using the pad_sequences function.
Model Architecture
Embedding Layer: Converts integer sequences into dense vectors of a fixed size, providing a dense representation of the words.
LSTM Layer: A Long Short-Term Memory layer that processes the sequence data and retains temporal information, addressing the limitations of traditional RNNs by preventing the vanishing gradient problem.
Dense Layer: Outputs a probability distribution over the vocabulary using a softmax activation function, which is crucial for multi-class classification tasks.
Model Training
Data Splitting: The data is split into features (input sequences) and targets (next words) for supervised learning.
Compilation: The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and categorical crossentropy loss function to effectively train the model.
Training: The model is trained over 50 epochs with a validation split to monitor performance and ensure generalization.
Prediction
Prediction Function: A function is provided to generate predictions of the next word(s) given a seed text.
Process: The function tokenizes and pads the seed text, uses the LSTM model to predict the next word, and appends the predicted word to generate coherent text sequences.
Results
The performance of the model is evaluated using accuracy and loss metrics. The trained LSTM model can generate meaningful text based on the seed text input, demonstrating the effectiveness of LSTM networks in handling sequential data and generating text.
